# What is it?

It's for playing Slideshare Karaoke with a group. There's three rotating decks you can choose each round. When a deck is
finished, it's moved to the played directory.

You'll need `pdftk` and `evince` installed.

# Game Setup

Get a big bunch of PDF slide decks and put them in the `slides/unplayed` directory. 

To start the game:

> ./play.php

To put all of the already played slides back in rotation:

> ./reset

# Notes

It's pretty bad, I wrote it while watching a movie. But it works? Kinda?

# Ideas I Never Implemented

- Use timeout command to timebox the slide
- Use fswebcam to optionally take a victory photo and tweet it

# License

MIT but treat me to a drink if you want.
